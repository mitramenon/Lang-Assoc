These genotypes were obtained from Dan Gate's github [https://github.com/danjgates/AdaptationScripts2/tree/master/Genotypes] used for his preprint. 

Since the IDs here are different from those in SeeDs_info.csv file, to get lat-long I merged the genotype file and the .csv file using only the SEEDGWAS* part of the sampleID.
There were ~37 duplicate SampleIDs, so I retained only the individual with least missing data. 
All chromosomes were combined and converted to a hapmap format file and then to vcf. 
vcf was filtered to randomly retain 5% of the SNPs to hopefully get rid of most of the LD. 
Other basic filtering also done.
